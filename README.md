# Rail fare increases: Charts explain passengers' frustration

In January 2019 as rail fares increased we [published](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-46606525) an analysis of official data which showed that rail users were paying more for worsening delays, shortages of staff and, in some areas, an ageing fleet of carriages.

The analysis included scripts in both R (analysis, visualisation) and Python (scraping).

This is the fifth story the data unit has done on rail fare rises. In August 2018 we reported [Commuters 'pay fifth of salary' on season ticket](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-fares-salary), and 12 months before that we reported [Commuters to pay Â£100 more in 2018](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-season-ticket-rises-2018). In January 2017 we published [Rail fares: Who are the season ticket winners and losers?](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-season-ticket-rises) and in September 2016 we published [Rail season tickets cost 10% of net pay](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-season-tickets).

## Scripts and code

* The notebook [traindelays](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-fare-increases-2019/blob/master/traindelays.Rmd) details the process of analysing ORR data on train delays.
* The R notebook [7periodcomparison](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-fare-increases-2019/blob/master/7periodcomparison.Rmd) takes the periodic data produced by the ORR and produces totals for 7 periods, allowing for a comparison between the delays to date, and those for the same 7-period dates in previous years.
* [Python script to scrape Twitter accounts](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-fare-increases-2019/blob/master/traintweetscraper.py)
* The R markdown file [traintweetsrmdonly](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/rail-fare-increases-2019/blob/master/traintweetsrmdonly.Rmd) details the process of analysing tweets by train company accounts. This is not saved as a notebook because the resulting HTML file is over 40MB!
